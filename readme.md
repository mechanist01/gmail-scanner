```

### Gmail-Specific Setup

If you're using Gmail with 2-Factor Authentication:
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ App passwords
3. Generate an app password for this script
4. Use that app password instead of your regular password

## Output Files

The script generates three types of output files:

1. `personalized_senders_[TIMESTAMP].csv`
   - Columns: Sender Name, Email Address, Full Header
   - Lists all senders who used your name in communications

2. `domain_analysis_[TIMESTAMP].csv`
   - Columns: Domain, Categories, Unique Senders, Total Emails, Sender List, Unsubscribe URL, Token, Last Updated
   - Groups communications by domain
   - Shows categorization and frequency
   - Includes unsubscribe information
   - Only includes domains with 2+ emails

3. `previously_scanned.txt`
   - Maintains record of scanned emails
   - Used to avoid duplicate scanning
   - Updated after each successful scan

## Privacy and Security Notes
