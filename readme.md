  - Cloud Services (Google, Dropbox, iCloud)
  - Subscription Services (Netflix, Spotify, Disney+)
  - Gaming (Steam, Epic, PlayStation)
  - Professional (Slack, Zoom, GitHub)
  - Travel (Airbnb, Booking, Uber)
- Detects personalized emails using your name
- Extracts and tracks unsubscribe links with tokens
- Maintains history of scanned emails to avoid duplicates
- Generates detailed CSV reports for easy analysis
- Automated unsubscribe functionality for bulk email management
- Supports multiple email encoding formats
- Compatible with Gmail and other IMAP servers

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Access to an email account via IMAP
- For Gmail users: App Password if 2FA is enabled

## Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install imaplib requests
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the scripts:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mechanist01/gmail-scanner
cd email-scanner
```

2. Make sure you have the required Python packages installed

## Email Scanner Usage

The scanner script uses command line arguments for configuration:

```bash
python inboxscanner2.py -e EMAIL -p PASSWORD -n NAME [-m MONTHS] [-s SERVER]
```

Arguments:
- `-e, --email`: Your email address (required)
- `-p, --password`: Your password or app password (required, use quotes if contains spaces)
- `-n, --name`: Your name to scan for (required)
- `-m, --months`: Number of months to scan (optional, default: 12)
- `-s, --server`: IMAP server (optional, default: imap.gmail.com)

Example:
```bash
# Basic usage with Gmail
python inboxscanner2.py -e your.email@gmail.com -p "your app password" -n "Your Name"
```

## Unsubscriber Usage

After running the scanner and generating the domain analysis CSV, you can use the unsubscriber to automatically process unsubscribe requests:

```bash
python unsubscriber.py -e EMAIL -p PASSWORD -c CSV_PATH [-s SERVER] [-d DAYS]
```

Arguments:
- `-e, --email`: Your email address (required)
- `-p, --password`: Your password or app password (required)
- `-c, --csv`: Path to the domain analysis CSV file (required)
- `-s, --server`: IMAP server (optional, default: imap.gmail.com)
- `-d, --days`: Number of days back to search for unsubscribe links (optional, default: 30)

Example:
```bash
python unsubscriber.py -e your.email@gmail.com -p "your app password" -c "domain_analysis_20250104_120530.csv"
```

### Preparing the CSV for Unsubscribing

The domain analysis CSV contains several columns that control the unsubscribe process:

1. `Delete`: Set this column to "yes" for domains you want to unsubscribe from
2. `List-Unsubscribe`: Automatically populated by the scanner, indicates if unsubscribe link is available
3. `Domain`: The email sender's domain

To prepare for unsubscribing:
1. Open the generated domain analysis CSV in your preferred spreadsheet software
2. Review the domains and their email frequencies
3. In the "Delete" column, enter "yes" for any domain you want to unsubscribe from
4. Save the CSV file
5. Run the unsubscribe script with the path to your modified CSV

Note: The unsubscriber will only process domains where both "Delete" is "yes" AND "List-Unsubscribe" is "yes"

### Gmail-Specific Setup

If you're using Gmail with 2-Factor Authentication:
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ App passwords
3. Generate an app password for this script
4. Use that app password instead of your regular password
5. Important: After completing your unsubscribe operations, return to your Google Account settings and delete the temporary app password for security

## Output Files

The scripts generate several types of output files:

1. `personalized_senders_[TIMESTAMP].csv`
   - Columns: Sender Name, Email Address, Full Header
   - Lists all senders who used your name in communications

2. `domain_analysis_[TIMESTAMP].csv`
   - Columns: Domain, Categories, Unique Senders, Total Emails, Sender List, Unsubscribe URL, Token, Last Updated
   - Groups communications by domain
   - Shows categorization and frequency
   - Includes unsubscribe information
   - Only includes domains with 2+ emails

3. `unsubscribe_log_[TIMESTAMP].txt`
   - Detailed log of unsubscribe operations
   - Records successful and failed attempts
   - Timestamps for each operation
   - Error messages and debugging information

4. `previously_scanned.txt`
   - Maintains record of scanned emails
   - Used to avoid duplicate scanning
   - Updated after each successful scan

## Privacy and Security Notes

- The script runs locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers
- Credentials are used only for IMAP connection
- All scan results are stored locally
- The script does not modify or delete any emails
- App passwords should be deleted after use

## Limitations

- Only scans the inbox folder
- Requires IMAP access to be enabled
- May be limited by email provider's IMAP restrictions

- Password parsing with spaces
- Unsubscribe link failures
- Invalid CSV formatting
