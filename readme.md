cd email-scanner
```

2. Make sure you have the required Python packages installed

## Configuration

Before running the scanner, you need to configure the following in the `main()` function:

```python
email_address = "your.email@gmail.com"    # Your email address
password = "your-app-password-here"       # Your password/app password
name_to_scan = "Your Name"                # Your name to scan for
months_to_scan = 12                       # Number of months to scan
```

### Gmail-Specific Setup

If you're using Gmail with 2-Factor Authentication:
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ App passwords
3. Generate an app password for this script
4. Use that app password instead of your regular password

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python email_scanner.py
```

The script will:
1. Connect to your email server
2. Scan emails from the specified period
3. Generate a report of findings
4. Save results to a timestamped file
5. Maintain a record of previously scanned emails

## Output Files

The script generates two types of output files:

1. `email_scan_results_[TIMESTAMP].txt`
   - Contains detailed scan results
   - Lists discovered services and accounts
   - Shows personalized senders

2. `previously_scanned.txt`
   - Maintains record of scanned emails
   - Used to avoid duplicate scanning
   - Updated after each successful scan

## Sample Output Structure
